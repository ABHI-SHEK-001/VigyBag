# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



#GitHub Access Token for showing the team members
- make a .env file at root directory
- add github access token, add this line [ VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" ]
 
 ### How to get access token

## Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):

- Go to your GitHub account settings.
- Navigate to the "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens" section.
- Click on "Generate new token" and follow the prompts to create a new token.
- Make sure to select the appropriate scopes based on the permissions your application requires. For fetching public data, the public_repo scope should be sufficient
